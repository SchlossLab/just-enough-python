I wish I had time to cover everything in-depth, but then I'd have to change the 
title from "[Just Enough Python](just-enough-python.qmd)" to "Way More Python 
Than We Could Possibly Cover In An Hour". 
So as a compromise, here's just a little more Python.

### more comprehensions

#### dictionary comprehensions

```{python}
#| filename: "Python"
movies = ['star wars episode V', 'the godfather', 'the dark knight']
years = [1980, 1972, 2008]
movie_dict = {}
for movie, year in zip(movies, years):
    movie_dict[movie] = year
movie_dict
```


```{python}
#| filename: "Python"
movies = ['star wars episode V', 'the godfather', 'the dark knight']
years = [1980, 1972, 2008]
movie_dict = {movie: year for movie, year in zip(movies, years)}
```

#### set comprehensions

Use a set instead of a list when order doesn't matter and you want every item
to be unique. 

```{python}
#| filename: "Python"
myset = set([1,2,2,2,3,3,4])
print(myset)
```

```{python}
#| filename: "Python"
presidents = ["George Washington", "John Adams", "Thomas Jefferson", 
              "James Madison Jr", "James Monroe", "John Quincy Adams"]
first_names = {name.split()[0] for name in presidents}
print(first_names)
```

Looking up whether a set contains an item is more efficient than using a list.

## packages

Using packages works a little differently between R and Python.

In R, you can refer to a function from any package you have installed with double colons:

```{R pkg-syntax}
#| filename: R script
#| eval: false
dplyr::tibble(a = 1:3, b = 4:6)
```

Alternatively, you can first load the package at the top of your script so you
can call the functions you want to use without specifying the package name every
time you use them.

```{R library}
#| filename: R script
#| eval: false
library(dplyr)
tibble(a = 1:5, b = 6:10) %>%
    filter(a > 3)
```


In Python, you must `import` a package before you can use anything from it and
reference the package name like this:

```{python import-pkg}
#| filename: Python script
#| eval: false
import pandas
pandas.DataFrame(data = {'a': [1,2,3], 'b': [4,5,6]})
```

You can give a package a nickname to cut down on the characters you have to type.
`pandas` is often renamed to `pd`:


```{python import-pkg-pd}
#| filename: Python script
#| eval: false
import pandas as pd
DataFrame(data = {'a': [1,2,3], 'b': [4,5,6]})
```

Alternatively, you can choose to import only the functions you want to use from a package:

```{python import-pkg-dataframe}
#| filename: Python script
#| eval: false
from pandas import DataFrame
DataFrame(data = {'a': [1,2,3], 'b': [4,5,6]})
```
